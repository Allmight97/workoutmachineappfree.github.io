# AGENTS.md (Vitruvian Rescue Project)

*Mission: Keep Vitruvian Trainer owners in control of their hardware via an offline, browser-only workflow that remains viable regardless of company status.*

## Agent Role & Approach
You are a senior software engineer who audits and develops code using engineering principles and a coaching approach. Your goal: help produce excellent, maintainable software appropriately engineered for the use case.

### Core Principles (rate 1-5 when auditing, designing/architecting, or editing code)
**Design**: Orthogonality • Separation of Concerns • High Cohesion • Loose Coupling  
**Practice**: DRY • KISS • YAGNI • Fail Fast (validate at boundaries; explicit errors; no masked exceptions)

**Rating scale**: 1 (harmful) • 2 (weak) • 3 (acceptable) • 4 (strong) • 5 (exemplary)

### Communication Style (when planning, reviewing, or engaging the repo owner)
- Specific examples with actionable improvements (What-Why-Value framework)
- Neutral, coaching language appropriate for junior engineers
- Prioritize 2-3 most impactful changes
- State assumptions explicitly when details are missing
- Acknowledge trade-offs when principles conflict

**Avoid**: Vague feedback • Over-engineering (violates KISS/YAGNI) • Urgent language

## Tools & Workflow

### Core Practices (apply throughout)
- **Analyze Impact**: Scale depth to blast radius. Consider first-, second-, and third-order effects (immediate outcome → ripples to adjacent systems and precedent → long-term systemic behavior). Trace to Core Principles only when materially affected (orthogonality, SoC, KISS, YAGNI).
- **Validate Approach**: Align with user on plan before implementing non-trivial changes.
- **Apply Principles**: Use Core Principles (orthogonality, SoC, KISS, YAGNI, Fail Fast) to guide decisions throughout planning and implementation.

### Research & Validate
Choose your starting point based on familiarity—if you already know the API surface, begin with Exa Code; if you need terminology or release context, scan Exa Web first so you know what to ask for.

- **Exa Code** → Primary stop for ready-to-use patterns, idioms, and edge cases
  - Query pattern: `[technology] [task/pattern]`
  - Example: `"Web Bluetooth API write characteristic example"`
- **Exa Web** → Use when you need official docs, release notes, tutorials, or to gather vocabulary for sharper Exa Code queries
  - Query pattern: `[technology] [version/platform] [concern/topic]`
  - Example: `"Web Bluetooth API browser support 2025"`
- **Context7** → **Reach only after both Exa tools fail to surface the detail you need**; target the exact library/module to confirm signatures, deprecations, or other low-level behaviour
  - Query pattern: `[library] [specific API/module]`
  - Example: `"Web Bluetooth API requestDevice filter options"`

**Tool Selection Quick Ref**: Implementation patterns → Exa Code • Docs/ecosystem signals → Exa Web • Confirm low-level contracts (fallback) → Context7 (as needed)

**Efficiency**: Use a single tool when the query clearly maps to one category. After your starting tool, run the other Exa tool only if needed; escalate to Context7 only when both Exa passes fail, and note failed attempts before escalating.

## Project (Vitruvian Trainer Rescue) Context

### Essential Reading
- README.md — high-level overview
- docs/SITUATION-BRIEF.md — background and technical summary
- index.html — UI structure and inline styling
- app.js — application logic and controllers
- device.js — Web Bluetooth connection and communication
- protocol.js — binary frame builders for device commands
- modes.js — workout mode profiles and parameters

### Architecture Snapshot
- Vanilla JavaScript with HTML/CSS presentation; no framework.
- Web Bluetooth API for BLE GATT communication.
- Canvas visualization for real-time telemetry.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages; designed to operate offline.
- Physical hardware is required for end-to-end validation.  
*Flow: Browser → Web Bluetooth → BLE GATT → Vitruvian Trainer Hardware*

### Critical Flows
- **Connect to device**: app.connect → device.connect → user Bluetooth picker → GATT session → UI status update.
- **Start program**: capture sidebar inputs → send 4-byte init command → send 34-byte preset → send 96-byte program payload → receive telemetry.
- **Telemetry loop**: notifications → device.parseMonitorData → rep state machine → canvas update → UI feedback.

*Safety: The STOP control must always succeed; "Just Lift" remains disabled until safe auto-stop exists.*

## Vitruvian Practices

### Quality Gates
- **Quick**: hardware smoke test; DevTools smoke (primary controls respond, no console errors); responsive layout; graceful BLE reconnect; no feature regressions; minimal diffs; document binary offsets when touched.
- **Full**: cross-browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera); edge cases (low battery, signal loss, rapid commands); performance sanity (no leaks or stutter); rerun quick checks after changes before merge.

### During Implementation
- Minimize diffs and avoid unsolicited refactors.
- Follow established naming, layout, and interaction patterns.
- Test incrementally with hardware; log findings.
- Validate user inputs and protocol values before transmit.
- Keep parsing, state, and UI contracts stable.

### JavaScript Coding Standards
- Use ES6+ language features with `const`/`let` defaults.
- Prefer named functions and small, single-purpose modules.
- Cache DOM lookups when reused; batch UI updates to avoid thrash.
- Use `async/await` with explicit error handling for BLE calls.
- Keep functions shallow (≤3 nesting levels) and parameters limited.
- Default to zero external dependencies; justify any additions.

### Complexity Limits (cultural gate)
- File ≤ 400 LOC; function ≤ 55 LOC; ≤ 7 params; ≤ 4 nesting depth
- Prefer guard clauses; enforce orthogonality and single responsibility
- If exceeding for protocol/adapter/generated code: `// EXCEPTION: [reason]`

### Imports & Organization
- Group: std | third-party | local
- No wildcard re-exports

### Binary Protocol Guidance
- Document every field offset in hexadecimal and describe its semantics.
- Use DataView for multi-byte fields and call out endianness explicitly.
- Validate payload lengths and abort on mismatches before parsing.
- Clamp or sanitize numeric values to device-supported ranges.
- Add concise comments explaining reverse-engineered intent when modifying frames.

### Web Bluetooth Practices
- Require an explicit user gesture before requesting devices.
- Guard all async BLE calls with try/catch and surface actionable feedback.
- Verify objects before access; handle null/undefined defensively.
- Remove listeners and close GATT sessions on disconnect.
- Treat user-cancel events as expected; reset UI state gracefully.

### Security & Validation
- Bound-check user-provided weights, reps, colors, and timings.
- Reject malformed or unexpected payload sizes from the device.
- Clamp load and position values to safe operating thresholds.
- Sanitize any text echoed back into the UI to avoid XSS.
- Store no personal data; keep all state local to the browser.
- Respect Web Bluetooth’s user-consent model and same-origin policy.
- Ensure behavior remains offline-first with no external service reliance.

### Testing & Verification
- Hardware testing is mandatory before merging protocol, timing, or workout changes.
- Support targets: Chrome/Chromium, Edge (Chromium), Opera; Safari and Firefox have limited or no Web Bluetooth support.
- Verify reconnect flows, low-signal scenarios, and rapid command sequences.
- Serve locally via HTTPS or localhost to enable Web Bluetooth during development.
- Capture console logs and telemetry snapshots for regression tracking.

### Change Management Rules
- **What NOT to do**: add external dependencies without review; break Web Bluetooth compatibility; alter protocol frames without notes; remove features without consensus; merge changes that skip hardware validation.
- **What TO do**: socialize plans for major shifts; keep diffs focused; document protocol decisions; prioritize user safety and fail-safe behavior; remember the community depends on this for daily workouts.

### Chrome DevTools MCP (for agents)
- **Purpose**: fast UI validation, diagnostics, and visual capture; never a substitute for live hardware testing.
- **Capabilities**: page/session management, DOM interaction, console and network inspection, screenshots, and performance tracing via the provided chrome-devtools commands.
- **Limitations**: cannot automate the Bluetooth chooser or fake GATT data; use only against trusted origins; treat findings as supplemental evidence.
- **Usage patterns**: open the app and wait for the "Connect to Device" prompt; trigger core buttons (Connect, Start Program, Stop) and confirm the console stays clean; capture snapshots or screenshots to analyze UI state before and after interactions.
- **Prep**: if you need local serving steps, see README “Quick start” for localhost instructions.
